<p> The biological and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated based upon the estimated
 effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate 
of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar
 System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is
 the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could 
cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by
 technology and the effects may last for up to five million years.In turn, technology may result
 in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary 
pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.</p>
<p> Over time intervals of hundreds of millions of years, random celestial events pose a global
 risk to the biosphere, which can result in mass extinctions. These include impacts by comets or
 asteroids with diameters of 5–10 km (3.1–6.2 mi) or more, and the possibility of a massive stellar
 explosion, called a supernova, within a 100-light-year radius of the Sun, called a Near-Earth supernova.
 Other large-scale geological events are more predictable. If the long-term effects of global warming are
 disregarded, Milankovitch theory predicts that the planet will continue to undergo glacial periods at least
 until the Quaternary glaciation comes to an end. These periods are caused by variations in eccentricity, 
axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit. As part of the ongoing supercontinent cycle, plate tectonics
 will probably result in a supercontinent in 250–350 million years. Some time in the next 1.5–4.5 billion years,
 the axial tilt of the Earth may begin to undergo chaotic variations, with changes in the axial tilt of up to 90°. </p> 
<p> During the next four billion years, the luminosity of the Sun will steadily increase, resulting in a rise in
 the solar radiation reaching the Earth. This will result in a higher rate of weathering of silicate minerals, 
which will cause a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In about 600 million years from now,
 the level of CO<sub>2</sub> will fall below the level needed to sustain C<sub>3</sub> carbon fixation 
photosynthesis used by trees. 
Some plants use the C<sub>4</sub> carbon fixation method, allowing them to persist at CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations as low as 10 
parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether. 
The extinction of plants will be the demise of almost all animal life, since plants are the base of the 
food chain on Earth.</p> 
<p> In about one billion years, the solar luminosity will be 10% higher than at present.
 This will cause the atmosphere to become a "moist greenhouse", resulting in a runaway evaporation of the oceans.
 As a likely consequence, plate tectonics will come to an end, and with them the entire carbon cycle.
Following this event, in about 2-3 billion years, the planet's magnetic dynamo may cease, causing the
 magnetosphere to decay and leading to an accelerated loss of volatiles from the outer atmosphere. 
Four billion years from now, the increase in the Earth's surface temperature will cause a runaway greenhouse effect, 
heating the surface enough to melt it. By that point, all life on the Earth will be extinct.
The most probable fate of the planet is absorption by the Sun in about 7.5 billion years, after the star has
 entered the red giant phase and expanded beyond the planet's current orbit.</p>
<h2> Human influence </h2>
<p> <font size=3> <i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main articles: Conservation biology, Global warming, and Human impact
 on the environment </i> </font> </p>
<p> Humans play a key role in the biosphere, with the large human population dominating many of Earth's ecosystems.
This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, 
now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s
 has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007.At current rates,
 about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years.The Holocene extinction event is
 the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change.
In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. 
More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of g
lobal primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close
 to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p> The consequences of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last for at least five million years.
It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species
 that are opportunistic, such as pests and weeds. Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that
 prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to
 benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large 
vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.</p>
<p> There are multiple scenarios for known risks that can have a global impact on the planet.
 From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks.
 Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, 
warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a 
physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent 
disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion.
 There may also be the possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform.The actual odds of 
these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.</p>
<p> Should the human race become extinct, then the various features assembled by humanity will begin to decay.
 The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000 years. 
The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts,
 and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the
 sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.</p>

<p> As the Sun orbits the Milky Way, wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the
 Solar System.A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the perihelion distances of comets in 
the Oort cloud—a spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a light year of the Sun.Such an encounter
 can trigger a 40-fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System. Impacts from these comets
 can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth. These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every
 45 million years.The mean time for the Sun to collide with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately 
3 × 10<sup> 13</sup>years, which is much longer than the estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy,
 at ~1.3 × 10<sup>10</sup> years. This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring
 during the lifetime of the Earth.</p>
<p> The energy release from the impact of an asteroid or comet with a diameter of 5–10 km (3.1–6.2 mi) or larger 
is sufficient to create a global environmental disaster and cause a statistically significant increase in
 the number of species extinctions. Among the deleterious effects resulting from a major impact event is a 
cloud of fine dust ejecta blanketing the planet, which lowers land temperatures by about 15 °C (27 °F)
 within a week and halts photosynthesis for several months. The mean time between major impacts is estimated
 to be at least 100 million years. During the last 540 million years, simulations demonstrated that such an
 impact rate is sufficient to cause 5–6 mass extinctions and 20–30 lower severity events. 
This matches the geologic record of significant extinctions during the Phanerozoic Eon. 
Such events can be expected to continue into the future.</p>
<p> A supernova is a cataclysmic explosion of a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur
 on average once every 40 years.During the history of the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred
 within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with 
radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere.Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in 
the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects
 the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient 
to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food
 chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26 light years will reduce the ozone column density by half.
 On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32 light years once every few hundred million years, 
resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries.Over the next two billion years, 
there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will have a significant impact
 on the planet's biosphere.</p>
<p> The incremental effect of gravitational perturbations between the planets causes the inner Solar System 
as a whole to behave chaotically over long time periods. This does not significantly affect the
 stability of the Solar System over intervals of a few million years or less, but over billions of 
years the orbits of the planets become unpredictable. Computer simulations of the Solar System's evolution 
over the next five billion years suggest that there is a small (less than 1%) chance that a collision could
 occur between Earth and either Mercury, Venus, or Mars.During the same interval, the odds that the
 Earth will be scattered out of the Solar System by a passing star are on the order of one part in 105. 
In such a scenario, the oceans would freeze solid within several million years, leaving only a few pockets
 of liquid water about 14 km (8.7 mi) underground. There is a remote chance that the Earth will instead be 
captured by a passing binary star system, allowing the planet's biosphere to remain intact. The odds of this
 happening are about one chance in three million.</p>
