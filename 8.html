<p> The energy generation of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.
 This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process.
 Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region 
without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature at the core of the Sun is too low for
 nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to 
the net energy generation that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.</p>
<p> At present, nearly half the hydrogen at the core has been consumed, with the remainder of the atoms
 consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does
 their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support,
 which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure
 into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo
 fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.</p>

</figure>
<p> The result of this process has been a steady increase in the energy output of the Sun.
 When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity.
 The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years.
Likewise, in three billion years the Sun is expected to be 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core
 will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present.
 Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity
 reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter
 it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.</p>
<p> By this time, the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway.
 Although this could result in the Solar System being ejected from the newly combined galaxy,
 it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.</p>
<h3> Climate impact </h3> 
<p> The rate of weathering of silicate minerals will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes.
 This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert
 carbon dioxide gas into solid carbonates. Within the next 600 million years from the present, 
the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain C<sub>3 </sub>
photosynthesis:
 about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive,
the last living trees being evergreen conifers.However, C<sub>4</sub> carbon fixation can continue at much lower concentrations,
 down to above 10 parts per million. Thus plants using C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be able to survive for at least 0.8 billion
 years and possibly as long as 1.2 billion years from now, after which rising temperatures will make the
 biosphere unsustainable.Currently, C4 plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 1% of its known plant
 species. For example, about 50% of all grass species (Poaceae) use the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway, 
as do many species in the herbaceous family Amaranthaceae.</p>
<p> When the levels of carbon dioxide fall to the limit where photosynthesis is barely sustainable, 
the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to oscillate up and down. 
This will allow land vegetation to flourish each time the level of carbon dioxide rises due to 
tectonic activity and animal life. However, the long term trend is for the plant life on land to
 die off altogether as most of the remaining carbon in the atmosphere becomes sequestered in the Earth.
 Some microbes are capable of photosynthesis at concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> of a few parts per million,
 so these life forms would probably disappear only because of rising temperatures and the loss of the biosphere. </p>
<p> Plants—and, by extension, animals—could survive longer by evolving other strategies such as requiring less 
CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthetic processes,
 becoming carnivorous, adapting to desiccation, or associating with fungi.
 These adaptations are likely to appear near the beginning of the moist greenhouse (see further).</p>
<p> The loss of plant life will also result in the eventual loss of oxygen as well as ozone due to the respiration
 of animals, chemical reactions in the atmosphere, and volcanic eruptions, meaning less attenuation of DNA-damaging 
ultraviolet radiation,[74] as well as the death of animals; the first animals to disappear would be large mammals,
 followed by small mammals, birds, amphibians and large fish, reptiles and small fish, and finally invertebrates.
 Before this happened it's expected that life would concentrate at refugia of lower temperature such as high 
elevations where less land surface area is available, thus restricting population sizes. Smaller animals would
 survive better than larger ones because of lesser oxygen requirements, while birds would fare better than mammals
 thanks to their ability to travel large distances looking for colder temperatures. </p>
<p> In their work The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee have argued 
that some form of animal life may continue even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared.
 Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine
 the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global
 temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life.
 Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life.
 However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from 
asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through 
the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual
 loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p> As temperatures continue to rise, the last animal life will be driven back toward the poles,
 and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating
 during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and
 life would primarily be found in the oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic
 matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there
 too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of
 freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on 
living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia.
 As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years,
 and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes. </p>
<h3> Loss Of Oceans </h3> 
<figure style="float:right;">
  <img src="Venuspioneeruv.jpg" width=300 height=300 >
  <figcaption> <font size=3> The atmosphere of Venus is in a "supergreenhouse" <br> state. </font> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> One billion years from now, about 27% of the modern ocean will have been subducted into the mantle. 
If this process were allowed to continue uninterrupted, it would reach an equilibrium state where 65% 
of the current surface reservoir would remain at the surface.[50] Once the solar luminosity is 10% higher
 than its current value, the average global surface temperature will rise to 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F). 
The atmosphere will become a "moist greenhouse" leading to a runaway evaporation of the oceans. 
At this point, models of the Earth's future environment demonstrate that the stratosphere would contain
 increasing levels of water. These water molecules will be broken down through photodissociation by solar
 ultraviolet radiation, allowing hydrogen to escape the atmosphere. The net result would be a loss of
 the world's sea water by about 1.1 billion years from the present. This will be a simple dramatic step 
in annihilating all life on Earth. </p>
<p> There will be two variations of this future warming feedback: the "moist greenhouse" where water vapor
 dominates the troposphere while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere
 (if the oceans evaporate very quickly), and the "runaway greenhouse" where water vapor becomes a
 dominant component of the atmosphere (if the oceans evaporate too slowly). The Earth will undergo
 rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over 900 °C (1,650 °F) as the atmosphere will
 be totally overwhelmed by water vapor, causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life,
 perhaps in about three billion years. In this ocean-free era, there will continue to be surface reservoirs
 as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle,[50] where it is estimated there is an
 amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth's oceans.
 Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rainstorms, but for the 
most part the planet would be a dry desert with large dunefields covering its equator, and a few
 salt flats on what was once the ocean floor, similar to the ones in the Atacama Desert in Chile.</p>
<p> With no water to lubricate them, plate tectonics would very likely stop and the most visible signs of geological
 activity would be shield volcanoes located above mantle hotspots.[84][74] In these arid conditions the planet 
may retain some microbial and possibly even multi-cellular life.[84] Most of these microbes will be halophiles
 and life could find too refuge in the atmosphere as has been proposed that could have happened on Venus.
 However, the increasingly extreme conditions will likely lead to the extinction of the prokaryotes between 
1.6 billion years and 2.8 billion years from now, with the last of them living in residual ponds of water
 at high latitudes and heights or in caverns with trapped ice; underground life, however, could last longer.
 What happens next depends on the level of tectonic activity. A steady release of carbon dioxide by volcanic
 eruption could cause the atmosphere to enter a "supergreenhouse" state like that of the planet Venus.
 But as stated above without surface water, plate tectonics would probably come to a halt and most of the
 carbonates would remain securely buried until the Sun became a red giant and its increased luminosity
 heated the rock to the point of releasing the carbon dioxide. </p>
<p> The loss of the oceans could be delayed until two billion years in the future if the total 
atmospheric pressure were to decline. A lower atmospheric pressure would reduce the greenhouse effect,
 thereby lowering the surface temperature. This could occur if natural processes were to remove the nitrogen
 from the atmosphere. Studies of organic sediments has shown that at least 100 kilopascals (0.99 atm)
 of nitrogen has been removed from the atmosphere over the past four billion years; enough to effectively 
double the current atmospheric pressure if it were to be released. This rate of removal would be sufficient
 to counter the effects of increasing solar luminosity for the next two billion years. </p>
<p> By 2.8 billion years from now, the surface temperature of the Earth will have reached 422 K (149 °C; 300 °F),
 even at the poles. At this point, any remaining life will be extinguished due to the extreme conditions.
 If the Earth loses its surface water by this point, the planet will stay in the same conditions until
 the Sun becomes a red giant.[84] If this scenario doesn't happen, then in about 3–4 billion years the 
amount of water vapour in the lower atmosphere will rise to 40% and a moist greenhouse effect will commence
 once the luminosity from the Sun reaches 35–40% more than its present-day value.
 A "runaway greenhouse" effect will ensue, causing the atmosphere to heat up and raising the surface
 temperature to around 1,600 K (1,330 °C; 2,420 °F). This is sufficient to melt the surface of the planet.
 However, most of the atmosphere will be retained until the Sun has entered the red giant stage. </p>
<p> With the extinction of life, 2.8 billion years from now, it is also expected that Earth biosignatures 
will disappear, to be replaced by signatures caused by non-biological processes. </p>
<h3> Red Giant Stage </h3> 
<figure style="float:right;">
  <img src="240px-Sun_red_giant.svg.png" width=350 height=300 >
  <figcaption> <font size=3> The size of the current Sun (now in the main sequence)<br> compared to 
its estimated size during its red giant phase </font> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> Once the Sun changes from burning hydrogen at its core to burning hydrogen around its shell,
 the core will start to contract and the outer envelope will expand. The total luminosity will 
steadily increase over the following billion years until it reaches 2,730 times the Sun's current
 luminosity at the age of 12.167 billion years. Most of Earth's atmosphere will be lost to space and
 its surface will consist of a lava ocean with floating continents of metals and metal oxides as well
 as icebergs of refractory materials, with its surface temperature reaching more than 2,400 K 
(2,130 °C; 3,860 °F). The Sun will experience more rapid mass loss, with about 33% of its total 
mass shed with the solar wind. The loss of mass will mean that the orbits of the planets will expand.
 The orbital distance of the Earth will increase to at most 150% of its current value. </p>
<p> The most rapid part of the Sun's expansion into a red giant will occur during the final stages, 
when the Sun will be about 12 billion years old. It is likely to expand to swallow both Mercury and Venus,
 reaching a maximum radius of 1.2 AU (180,000,000 km). The Earth will interact tidally with the Sun's
 outer atmosphere, which would serve to decrease Earth's orbital radius. Drag from the chromosphere of
 the Sun would also reduce the Earth's orbit. These effects will act to counterbalance the effect of mass
 loss by the Sun, and the Earth will probably be engulfed by the Sun. </p>
<p> The drag from the solar atmosphere may cause the orbit of the Moon to decay.
 Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of 18,470 km (11,480 mi), it will
 cross the Earth's Roche limit. This means that tidal interaction with the Earth would break apart the Moon,
 turning it into a ring system. Most of the orbiting ring will then begin to decay,
 and the debris will impact the Earth. Hence, even if the Earth is not swallowed up by the Sun,
 the planet may be left moonless. The ablation and vaporization caused by its fall on a decaying
 trajectory towards the Sun may remove Earth's crust and mantle, then finally destroy it after at most
 200 years. Following this event, Earth's sole legacy will be a very slight increase (0.01%)
 of the solar metallicity. </p>
<p> Alternatively, should the Earth survive being engulfed to the Sun, the ablation and 
vaporization mentioned before may strip both its crust and mantle leaving just its core. </p>
<h3> Post red-giant stage </h3> 
<figure style="float:right;">
  <img src="240px-NGC7293_(2004).jpg" width=350 height=300 >
  <figcaption> <font size=3> The Helix nebula, a planetary nebula similar to what the <br> 
Sun will produce in 8 billion years.  </font> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> After fusing helium in its core to carbon, the Sun will begin to collapse again, 
evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula.
 In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked,
 with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will
 extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.</p>
<p> In about 65 billion years, it estimated that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, 
assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon
 system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth. </p>
<p> Over time intervals of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star. 
As a consequence, the orbits of their planets can become disrupted, potentially ejecting them from the system 
entirely. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years and not ejected from its
 orbit by a stellar encounter, its ultimate fate will be that it collides with the black dwarf Sun due
 to the decay of its orbit via gravitational radiation, in 10<sup>20</sup> (100 quintillion) years. </p>
