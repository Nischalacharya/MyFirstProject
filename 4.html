<p> Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). 
Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.
 Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time.
 Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and 
theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. 
The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity,
 which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the 
Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity
 and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.</p>
<h2> Mythologies </h2> 
<p> <i> <font size=default> Main articles: Creation myth, Creator deity, and Religious cosmology </font> </i> </p>
<p> Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and universe.
 Cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth. 
There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin
, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is now to a 
god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).</p>
<p> Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various classification schemes for the various
 themes that appear in creation stories.For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; 
such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. 
In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, 
as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), 
the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation
 narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is 
created from the union of male and female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, 
the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god
 — as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology – or from 
chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates
 from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers,or the yin and yang of the Tao.</p>
<h2>Philosophical models</h2>
<p> <i> <font size=default> Further information: Cosmology </p>
<p> See also: Pre-Socratic philosophy, Physics (Aristotle), Hindu cosmology, Islamic cosmology, and Philosophy of space and time </font> </i> </p>
<p> The pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed some of the earliest
 philosophical concepts of the Universe.The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances 
can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. 
In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) 
and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single 
primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student,
 Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material
 to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or 
dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed
 fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element 
model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles'
 elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed
 that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe 
that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately
 rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.</p> 
<p> Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary Parmenides made the radical 
suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging 
and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as t? ?? (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed
 implausible to many Greeks, but his student Zeno of Elea challenged them with several famous paradoxes. 
Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity,
 as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he
 believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and that cumulative stellar magnitude
 is only finitely multiplicative.</p>
<p> The Indian philosopher Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika school, developed a notion
 of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance. In the 5th 
century AD, the Buddhist atomist philosopher Dignaga proposed atoms to be point-sized,
 durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed 
that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.</p>
<p> The notion of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the 
three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian philosopher, 
John Philoponus, presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion 
of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by
 the early Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia Gaon 
(Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali (Algazel).</p>

</figure>
<p> Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after astronomy began with the Babylonian
 astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise
 for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus. </p>
<p> Later Greek philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with 
developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent
 model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the
 model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal
 matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.</p> 
<p> De Mundo (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, "Five elements, situated in 
spheres in five regions, the less being in each case surrounded by the greater—namely,
 earth surrounded by water, water by air, air by fire, and fire by ether—make up the whole Universe".</p>
<p> This model was also refined by Callippus and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was
 brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy. The success of
 such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) 
can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the Fourier modes). Other Greek scientists, 
such as the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated (according to Stobaeus account) that at 
the center of the Universe was a "central fire" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.</p>
<p> The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known individual to propose a heliocentric model
 of the Universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book 
<i> The Sand Reckoner</i> describes Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote: </p>
 <p style="padding-left:100px";> You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere 
the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between
 the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from
 astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, 
as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just
 mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves
 about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the 
sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he
 supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of
 the sphere bears to its surface </p>
<p> Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax
 had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved
 around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient
 times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent
 with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar
 parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch
 suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon):Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and
 saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move
 relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that
 was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments.

 following passage from Plutarch suggests <i> (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon) </i>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:100px";> Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict 
Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe [i.e. the Earth], ... 
supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time,
 about its own axis</p>

<p> The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia,
 a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.[145][146][147] According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to 
prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric
 cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that
 the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.
 Alternatively, he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a geometric model for it, and by developing methods 
to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century. During the Middle Ages, 
heliocentric models were also proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata, and by the Persian astronomers Albumasarand Al-Sijzi.</p>

<p> The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived 
Aristarchus's perspective that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on its
 axis and if the sun were placed at the center of the Universe.</p>
<p style="padding-left:500px";> In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place
 than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time? </p> 
<p style="padding-left:550px";> —Nicolaus Copernicus, in Chapter 10, Book 1 of <i> De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum </i> (1543) </p> 
<p> As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC),
 Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar
 Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi
 also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon
 of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).
<p> This cosmology was accepted by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists.Edmund Halley (1720) and Jean-Philippe 
de Chéseaux (1744) noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the 
prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century.
Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the
 matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity. This instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion.
One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies
 that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the Universe has a negligibly small overall
 density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert. A significant astronomical 
advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright, Immanuel Kant and others of nebulae.</p>
<p> In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, the prevailing view still was that the Universe consisted entirely of the Milky Way
 Galaxy. Using the Hooker Telescope, Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in several spiral nebulae and in 1922–1923 proved 
conclusively that Andromeda Nebula and Triangulum among others, were entire galaxies outside our own, thus proving that Universe
 consists of multitude of galaxies.</p>
<p> The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the Universe. </p>
