<p> Space and survival refers to the idea that the long-term survival of the human species and 
civilization requires proper use of the resources of outer space and the need for space colonization 
and space science. The concept posits that inaction could lead to human extinction.
 A related observation is that limited time and resources may be available for the colonization of space.
 Various scenarios for human survival have been discussed in science and popular culture, particularly
 humanity's prospects after catastrophic events in the solar system and factors that could help
 or hinder survival.</p>
<p> The earliest appearance of a connection between space exploration and human survival appears
 in Louis J. Halle’s 1980 article in<i> Foreign Affairs </i> , in which he stated colonization of space
 will keep humanity safe should global nuclear warfare occur.
 This idea has received more attention in recent years as advancing technology makes cheap space 
travel more feasible </p>
<h3> Risk To Humanity </h3> 
<p> <font size=3> <i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main articles:
 Global catastrophic risks and Human extinction </font> </i> </p> 
<p> With space and human survival comes risk to the human species. A severe event in the future is
 one that could cause human extinction which is also known as an <b> existential risk </b> .
 Humanity’s long track record of surviving natural hazards suggests that, measured on a
 timescale of a couple of centuries, the existential risk posed by such hazards is rather small. 
Nevertheless, researchers have experienced an obstacle in studying human extinction as humanity has
 actually never been diminished during all of recorded history. Although this does not mean that 
it will not be in the future with natural existential scenarios such as: Meteor impact and
 large-scale volcanism; and anthropogenic-natural hybrid events like global warming and
 catastrophic climate change, or even global nuclear warfare. </p>
<h3> Survival of life and intelligence </h3> 
<p> Many of the same existential risks to humanity would destroy parts or all of Earth's biosphere as well.
 And although many have speculated about life and intelligence existing in other parts of space,
 Earth is the only place in the universe known to harbor life. </p>
<p> Eventually the Earth will be uninhabitable, at the latest when the Sun becomes a red giant
 in about 5 billion years. Mankind, or its intelligent descendants, then has to leave the Solar 
System to ensure survival of the human species. </p>
<h3> Space settlement </h3>
<p> Human extinction can be prevented by improving the physical barrier or increasing the mean
 distance between people and the potential extinction event.<i> <sup>[citation needed] </sup> </i>  For example,
 pandemics are controlled by placing exposed people in quarantine and evacuating healthy people away.
 The human lineage of genus <i> Homo </i>  has reduced from several species co-existing on Earth to just one
 — all others became extinct before the end of the last Ice age. This illustrates that<i> Homo sapiens </i> 
 is not immune to planetary disaster and that human survival may be better assured through the
 colonization of space. </p>
<p> Although space colonies do not yet exist, humans have had a continuous space presence since 2000 due 
to the International Space Station. Life support systems that enable people to live in space may 
also allow them to survive hazardous events. </p>
<h4> Multiple locations </h4> 
<p> Expanding the living area of the human species increases the mean distance between humans and 
any known hazardous event. People closest to the event are most likely to be killed or injured;
 people farthest from the event are most likely to survive. Increasing the number of places where 
humans live also helps to prevent extinction. For example, if a massive impact event occurred on 
Earth without warning, the human species could possibly become extinct; its art, culture and technology
 would be lost. However, if humans had previously colonized locations outside Earth, the opportunities
 for the survival and recovery of the species would be greater. </p>
<h4>  Critical stage </h4>
<p> There is concern that the human species may lose its organized societies or its technological
 knowledge, deplete resources or even become extinct before it colonizes
 space.<i> <sup> [citation needed] </sup></i> </p>
<p> The author Sylvia Engdahl wrote about the "critical stage", a period of time when a 
civilization has both the technology to expand into space and the technology to destroy
 itself.<i> <sup>[citation needed] </sup></i> Engdahl states that the human civilization is at a critical stage,
 but that the funding for space exploration and colonization is minuscule compared to the 
funding for weapons of mass destruction and military forces. Similar ideas have been discussed 
in terms of the Fermi paradox and the great filter.<i> <sup> [citation needed]  </sup></i> </p>
<h2> Equipment </h2> 
<h4> Spacesuits </h4>

<p> Spacesuits are required for astronauts to survive in space; they are the most essential piece 
of equipment with many features to help protect them from the dangers of space. Due to space being a 
vacuum, the suits are required to have oxygen, which is stored in tanks allowing astronauts to work
 or remain outside for 6 to 8.5 hours before having to return to the spacecraft.
 Water is also required to survive in space and the space suits have water supply bags in two sizes,
 21 or 32 US fl oz (620 or 950 ml), so astronauts do not suffer dehydration when outside the spacecraft.
 The suits are made from several layers of material; within these layers there is tubing all around
 which is filled with chilled water to help cool the suit.
 The suit is also insulated so the astronaut does not become too cold; the astronaut’s body
 heat is what is keeping them warm. The several layers protect the astronaut from space dust,
 which can travel faster than a bullet. The visors on the suit helmets are made with a special
 gold liner which protects the eyes<sup> <i> [clarification needed] </i> </sup> of the astronaut from sunlight.</p>
<h3> Space science </h3> 
<p> The observation and study of space protects Earth, as space hazards can be seen in advance
and, if discovered early enough, acted against. </p>
<h3> Near-Earth objects </h3>
 <p> Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and large meteoroids that come close to or
 collide with Earth. Spaceguard is the collective name for some of the efforts to discover and 
study NEOs, though these efforts are not sufficiently funded. </p>
 <h3> Objections </h3> 
<p> Many problems can occur when travelling in outer space. 
One of the biggest issues that may affect the human body is interstellar radiation.
 While the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere protects all living forms on the planet,
 this cannot be said for outer space. According to researchers from the University of Rochester Medical Center, 
a radiation equivalent to a mission to Mars can cause serious brain damage such as cognition problems and
 Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<h3> In fiction </h3> 
<p> Space as an aid to human survival is a staple themes of science fiction. Among the examples are: </p> 
<p> In the 1972 film Silent Running, a set of space stations out orbiting Saturn contain the remnants of Earth's ecosystem, after Earth's was destroyed by pollution.</p>

<p> In the Arthur C. Clarke short story "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth", humans are surviving on the Moon after the Earth was rendered uninhabitable by a nuclear war. </p>

<p>In Gateway by Frederik Pohl, those with the money to leave the dying Earth can hitch a ride on a starship that will either make them extremely wealthy or lead them to their death.</p>

<p>In the 2005 John Scalzi novel Old Man’s War, Earth itself is a backwater and the Colonial Defense Force must fight for the scarce habitable planets left.</p>

<p> In the Jack Vance omnibus volume Dying Earth, a far-future Earth is under a giant red sun that is about to go out forever.</p>

<p> The 2014 blockbuster “Interstellar” starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway follows the plot where a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole.</p>

<p> “Exogenesis Symphony” - a three part song by British rock band Muse. The song follows the journey of mankind and details the difficulties and actions that face Earth’s end. Part 1 (Overture) is the “jaded acceptance that civilisation will end” according to frontman Matthew Bellamy. He also states that Part 2 (Cross-Pollination) is “a desperate hope that sending astronauts to find and populate other planets will be successful alongside the recognition that this is the last hope”. Part 3 (Redemption) concludes the song and its source album, "The Resistance" (2009). The final part is a recognition by the astronauts that the extinction of Earth is a continuous cycle and that humanity must change its ways in order to save itself.</p>
