<p> The gravitational perturbations of the other planets in the Solar System combine to modify the orbit
 of the Earth and the orientation of its spin axis. These changes can influence the planetary climate. </p>
<h2> Glaciation </h2> 
<p> Historically, there have been cyclical ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher 
latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality
 induced by plate tectonics.The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because 
of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are
 a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer 
solstice with the aphelion.Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity 
changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05.
This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor 
axis to 99.88%, respectively.</p>
<p> The Earth is passing through an ice age known as the quaternary glaciation, and is presently in
 the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years.
However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay the onset 
of the next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global 
warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200)
 will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming
 induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would
 only have a limited impact in the long term. </p> 
<h2> Obliquity </h2> 
<figure style="float:right; padding:2px;">
  <img src="220px-Tidal_braking.svg.png" width=300 height=300>
  <figcaption> <font size=3> The rotational offset of the tidal bulge <br> exerts a net torque on the Moon, 
boosting<br> it while slowing the Earth's rotation. This <br> image is not to scale. </font> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> The tidal acceleration of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon
 distance. Friction effects—between the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface—can 
dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase the length 
of the day by more than 1.5 hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by
 about a half degree. The distance to the Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth 
radii during the same period.</p>
<p> Based on computer models, the presence of the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth,
 which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes.This stability is achieved because the Moon
 increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis, thereby avoiding resonances between the precession 
of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic)
.However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish.
 At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth,
 and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur
 between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.</p>
<p> A high obliquity would probably result in dramatic changes in the climate and may destroy the planet's
 habitability.When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly insolation at the equator is less
 than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for
 periods as long as 10 million years.</p>

</figure>
<p> Tectonics-based events will continue to occur well into the future and the surface will be steadily reshaped
 by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 
1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along
 the San Andreas Fault, while about 50 magnitude 9 events may be expected worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience
 about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the Old Faithful Geyser will likely cease to operate. 
The Niagara Falls will continue to retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,000–50,000 years.</p> 

In 10,000 years, the post-glacial rebound of the Baltic Sea will have reduced the depth by about 90 m (300 ft).
 The Hudson Bay will decrease in depth by 100 m over the same period.[30] After 100,000 years, the island of Hawaii
 will have shifted about 9 km (5.6 mi) to the northwest. The planet may be entering another glacial period by
 this time.</p>
<h2> Continental drift </h2>
<p> The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the
 surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to
 relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within
 the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will
 come to a halt.The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle
 convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.</p> 
<p> At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe.
 Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future.These geodynamic 
models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent.
 In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and
 the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior,
 Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.</p>
<p> As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision.
 In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle 
convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa,
 Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.</p>
<p> Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes
 water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model
 gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were 
to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% 
of the current ocean mass has been subducted.</p> 
<h3> Introversion </h3> 
<figure style="float:right; padding:2px;">
  <img src="PangeaUltimaRoughEstimation.png" width=400 height=400>
  <figcaption> <font size=3> A rough approximation of Pangaea Ultima, one of the three <br> models  for a
 future supercontinent. </font> </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> Christopher Scotese and his colleagues have mapped out the predicted motions several hundred million
 years into the future as part of the Paleomap Project.In their scenario, 50 million years from now the 
Mediterranean sea may vanish and the collision between Europe and Africa will create a long mountain range 
extending to the current location of the Persian Gulf. Australia will merge with Indonesia, and Baja
 California will slide northward along the coast. New subduction zones may appear off the eastern coast
 of North and South America, and mountain chains will form along those coastlines. To the south,
 the migration of Antarctica to the north will cause all of its ice sheets to melt. This, along with 
the melting of the Greenland ice sheets, will raise the average ocean level by 90 m (300 ft). The inland
 flooding of the continents will result in climate changes.</p>
<p> As this scenario continues, by 100 million years from the present the continental spreading will
 have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, 
North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around the southern tip of Africa. 
The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific
 Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return
 to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.</p>
<h3> Extroversion </h3> 
<p> The first scientist to extrapolate the current motions of the continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman
 of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue 
to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. 
He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar 
scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar 
would move across the Indian Ocean to collide with Asia.</p>
<p> n an extroversion model, the closure of the Pacific Ocean would be complete in about 350 million years.
This marks the completion of the current supercontinent cycle, wherein the continents split apart and then
 rejoin each other about every 400–500 million years.Once the supercontinent is built, 
plate tectonics may enter a period of inactivity as the rate of subduction drops by an order of magnitude.
 This period of stability could cause an increase in the mantle temperature at the rate of 30–100 °C (54–180 °F)
 every 100 million years, which is the minimum lifetime of past supercontinents. 
As a consequence, volcanic activity may increase. </p> 
<h3> Supercontinent </h3> 
<p> The formation of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will
 result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation.
The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting in an increase in the rate that organic material is buried. 
Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. 
This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result 
in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.</p>
<p> The formation of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, 
resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt. Rifts will form and the supercontinent
 will split up once more.The planet may then experience a warming period, as occurred during the Cretaceous period.</p>
<h2> Solidification of the outer core </h2> 
<p> The iron-rich core region of the Earth is divided into a 1,220 km (760 mi) radius solid inner core
 and a 3,480 km (2,160 mi) radius liquid outer core.[60] The rotation of the Earth creates convective eddies
 in the outer core region that cause it to function as a dynamo.This generates a magnetosphere about the Earth
 that deflects particles from the solar wind, which prevents significant erosion of the atmosphere from sputtering. 
As heat from the core is transferred outward toward the mantle, the net trend is for the inner boundary
 of the liquid outer core region to freeze, thereby releasing thermal energy and causing the solid inner
 core to grow. This iron crystallization process has been ongoing for about a billion years.
 In the modern era, the radius of the inner core is expanding at an average rate of roughly
 0.5 mm (0.02 in) per year, at the expense of the outer core.Nearly all of the energy needed to power
 the dynamo is being supplied by this process of inner core formation.</p>
<p> The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years
 from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other heavy elements. 
The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing.
Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, 
which may end the growth of the inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo.
 Without a functioning dynamo, the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short
 time period of roughly 10,000 years.The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in 
erosion of light elements, particularly hydrogen, from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, 
resulting in less favorable conditions for life.</p>
